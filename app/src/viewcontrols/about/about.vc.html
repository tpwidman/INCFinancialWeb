				<p><span>Infinite Made Simple (IMS)</span> was founded in 2011 and was rebranded as INC Financial in 2014. Josh had been
					working with a wealth management firm where he got his introduction to Infinite Banking before leaving to start what
					is now INC Financial. During those years his primary focus was, and still is, the Infinite Banking Concept.</p>

				<p>Many people around the country teach the Infinite Banking Concept which is sometimes referred to as Bank on Yourself,
					Private Family Financing, The Circle of Wealth or a host of other names. Usually these methods of introducing the concept
					requires you to read one of a few <span>books</span> which can take hours to read. After reading one of these <span>books</span>,
					the concept often has to be explained further.</p>

				<p>Josh recognized that many people who could benefit from the concept were not taking the time to read the <span>
		books</span> and were missing out on the power of Infinite Banking. So he devised a method of introducing the concept which
					is simple, clear and concise. While Nelson Nashâ€™s <span>book</span>, Becoming Your Own Banker: Unlocking the Infinite
					Banking Concept, is the foundation of the concept and is highly recommended by INC Financial, the first thing you should
					do is come to one of our introduction workshops.
