			Andy brings a wealth of finance and tax knowledge and experience to INC Financial. His professional experience includes
			thirteen years in accounting, with local and national Big 4 accounting firms as well as experience as a financial analyst
			for a Fortune 500 company. He has worked with a wide venue of small businesses and individuals handling small business
			accounting, business valuations and tax preparation. Realizing that individuals, small, medium and large companies need
			to know how and why to implement the Infinite Banking Concept, Andy joined forces with the INC Financial team in 2013.</p>

		<h3 id="IBTitle"> Infinite Banking </h3>
		<hr noshade id="IBhr">
		<p><span id="IMSBold">Infinite Made Simple (IMS)</span> was founded in 2011 and was rebranded as INC Financial in 2014. Josh
			had been working with a wealth management firm where he got his introduction to Infinite Banking before leaving to start
			what is now INC Financial. During those years his primary focus was, and still is, the Infinite Banking Concept.</p>
		<p>Many people around the country teach the Infinite Banking Concept which is sometimes referred to as Bank on Yourself, Private
			Family Financing, The Circle of Wealth or a host of other names. Usually these methods of introducing the concept requires
			you to read one of a few <span class="books">books</span> which can take hours to read. After reading one of these
			<span class="books">books</span>, the concept often has to be explained further.</p>
		<p>Josh recognized that many people who could benefit from the concept were not taking the time to read the <span class="books">
		books</span> and were missing out on the power of Infinite Banking. So he devised a method of introducing the concept which
			is simple, clear and concise. While Nelson Nashâ€™s <span class="books">book</span>, Becoming Your Own Banker: Unlocking
			the Infinite Banking Concept, is the foundation of the concept and is highly recommended by INC Financial, the first thing
			you should do is come to one of our introduction workshops.
