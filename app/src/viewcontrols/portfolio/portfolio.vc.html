<h2>Gwyn & Sam Moore // Owners</h2>
<p>“I was really impressed with how INC Financial presented the Infinite Banking Concept through the INC Wealth Strategy but have been even more impressed since I put the concept to work for me and my family.
If there was one thing I would change, it would be starting much sooner than I did. I would have liked to have known about this 30 years ago.”</p>

<h2>Mary Katherine Glisson // Partner</h2>
<p>“I couldn’t be happier with the INC Wealth Strategy process – we’re using loans to pay our house off in just 6 years! I love the flexibility too – I can pay our house off sooner if I want or later if an emergency comes up. The best part is my policy is still earning interest on the entire cash value – even though we have outstanding loans! There’s nothing else out there with this capability."</p>

<h2>Roman McDonald // Owner & Trainer</h2>
<p>“I have read several books on Infinite Banking and Bank On Yourself and INC Financial does a great job of breaking it down and making it simple through their INC Wealth Strategy. They walk you through the whole process and show how it can work for you”</p>
